            This generates the divisibility rule for any number. In school, we learned a simple one, if the sum of the digits is divisible by three then the number is divisible by three.
            As it turns out, there is a rule like this for every number. They are often not as nice as the one for three unfortunately. Upon completing this rule generator,
            I was able to write a factoring algorithm using these divisibility rules. You can find it <a href="{{ url_for('factor') }}">here</a>.
